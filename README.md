# Interactive Conway's Game of Life

To play the game:
  - Click on squares to bring them to life.
  - Click the 'Start Cycling' and 'Stop' buttons to make the cycle stop and start.
  - Click 'Clear' to clear the board and start fresh.
  - You can add elements on the fly if you wish, but it's best to stop cycling before clicking on the squares.
