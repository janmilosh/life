  <!--Conway's Game of Life: To play the game, expand result window so that the entire grid is visible. Click on squares to bring them to life. Click the 'Start Cycling' and 'Stop' buttons to make the cycle stop and start. Click 'Clear' to clear the board and start fresh. You can add elements on the fly if you wish, but it's best to stop cycling before clicking on the squares. For more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life-->
